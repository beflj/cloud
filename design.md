# Initial Architecture <br> GovCloud PaaS<br> Statens IT 

This document is an initial architecture for a project aimed at establishing the first version of a new operating model at Statens IT that uses cloud technologies to provide a managed platform for agile application development. The architecture describes which decisions that has been made and why for selected elements in a reference model.  Decisions reflect the needs identified for the first know applications and support a longer strategic perspective on the use of cloud technologies in the Danish public sector.

The first use of the document supports a decision of how to best host meterological and climate data free of charge for government and private data users starting from late 2019.

## Introduction
In the spring of 2018 a collaboration between the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI), the Agency for Governmental IT Services (SIT) and the Agency for Digitisation (DIGST) developed a proof of concept exploring a number of cloud technologies and practices. This architecture is a result of a that experience.

The Danish Meteorological Institute (Dan.: [Danmarks Meteorologiske Institut](http://www.dmi.dk/en/about/profile/introduction-to-dmi/), DMI) provides meteorological services in the Commonwealth of the Realm of Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and surrounding waters and airspace. The purpose of all activities is to safeguard human life and property. DMI’s many activities also act as background knowledge in terms of planning and decision-making in economic and environment sectors - especially within transport and industry businesses. DMI collects and processes meteorological, climatological and oceanographic measurements/observations, and measures, collects and compiles related geophysical parameters throughout the Realm. Conducting research and development within its area of expertise, DMI ensures efficient operations and state-of-the-art quality in all productions while monitoring and conducting research on global warming and the stratospheric ozone balance.

The purpose of the Agency for Governmental IT Services (Dan.: [Statens IT](https://statens-it.dk/english/), SIT) is to provide the Danish Government better, safer, and more cost-efficient IT operations and services. SIT focuses on accessibility, stability, efficiency and information security in four main areas of operation: personal computers for state employees, IT infrastructure, standardisation of generic administrative IT and standardised vendor contracts.  Currently SIT services 12 of 19 ministeries totalling 17.000 employees at 250 physical locations, and is scheduled to expand to more ministeries for a total of 35.000 employes. At this point, The Ministery of Defence, The Police and The Tax Authorities will be the only areas with separate IT operations.

The Agency for Digitisation (Dan.: [Digitaliseringsstyrelsen](https://en.digst.dk/), DIGST) was established in 2011 with joint public funding. Its purpose is to create and implement initiatives and policies regarding the digitalisation of the public sector. DIGST supports public sector efficency by providing digital services to citizens, businesses and government organisations. DIGST implements joint public projects and hosts The Danish Council for IT Projects and the government IT project model.

DIGST and SIT are both part of the Ministery of Finance and employs about 250 people each.

The Digital Strategy 2016-2020 is a joint public strategy for all levels of government: state, regions and municipalities. Among the many initiatives in the strategy to be supported by this architecture are *8.1 Good data and efficient data sharing* and *8.2 Robust operation of the common infrastructure*. During the realisation of the Digital Strategy it has become evident that public authorities on all levels of government struggle with a **time-to-market for new applications and integrations** that does not match the ambitions of integrated public service delivery, the ever-changing political and regulatory landscape and the  technological development in general.

Integrated in the The Digital Strategy is a joint public architecture framework, the Federated Digital Architecture (FDA, Dan. Fællesoffentlig Digital Arkitektur). Within the framework a number of reference architectures have been approved, especially the reference architecture for *sharing of data and documents* is relevant for this project. The GovCloud concept is an implementation of the pattern *shared data and application platform*.

## First Applications
Paramount to the establishment of a Government Cloud Platform is the succesful support of an initial large scale strategic project to prove the attractiveness of the architecture.

It has been the focus of a proof of concept to create collective experiences in different organisations, and this focus is continued in the initial version of the GovCloud Platform. DMI is an experienced application developer and service provider, and has applied this knowledge to support the development of this design. DIGST is experienced in policy development, and SIT has established mature IT operations. However, neither have experience with agile application developement. Hence DIGST has choosen to also take the role of application developer in a smaller project and SIT will use the platform to build its own platform services.

As drivers for the initial version of GovCloud, the following three applications have been choosen:

**DMI Data.** Meteorological and climate data are distributed widely today. The government has decided to provide these data under a open government data initiative to support growth of private businesses. DMI sees a potential of separating the generic operational aspects of data sharing from the knowledge and support of the specific data they produce.

In the future, data distribution to private consumers and other government organisations is expected to be done on the same infrastructure, whereas highly critical data distribution e.g. crisis management and defence, will continue in separate channels.

Experiences from countries with free-of-charge meterological data have shown the need for a way to contact data consumers in the case of e.g. erroneous data from failing sensors. As such DMI wants to register data consumers to support this. Registering data consumers also supports enforcing a *fair use* agreement.

## Problem
Customers of SIT (ministries and their agencies) are moving towards modern, cloud based platforms to improve time to market for new applications and integrations. SIT currently has no mature, formalised offering to meet this need. The problem can be describe as:

*What service offering will be the most attractive option for public agencies seeking the advantages of 'the cloud'?*

To address this problem , this document describes an initial architecture for a government cloud platform aimed at becoming customers' prefered Operating Model at SIT. It consists of a new governance model and a blue print for a technical solution supporting Platform as a Service.

Currently, SIT has a number of operating models (including ones based on SaaS and IaaS) that provide the stability and security required by the customers. This new model is believed to be preferred over existing ones because of the following characteristics:

- *Continuity of Service.* Existing models allow small and planned windows for maintainance. Cloud technologies typically offer a continuity with rolling updates of both platform and applications without any interruption.

- *Shorter Development Cycles and Rapid Changes.* Based on experiences from the proof of concept, customers may expect a rapid deployment cycle. If the suggested goals for deployment and changes are met (see [appendix](#suggested-initial-roadmap)), the GovCloud Platform will match that of existing cloud vendors.

To support the first applications, SIT must extend existing operating models with new high level use cases.

- *Public Data Distribution.* A private company wants to access data from a public organisation. SIT has suitable operating models and technology platform to support the re-use of public sector information. The government organisation holding data entrusts operational aspects to SIT in order to focus on tailoring the data service application and to help end users understand the data.

- *Application Development.* A government organisation decides that the GovCloud Platform is the future home of a new application. Early in the process SIT helps identify reusable services and data on the GovCloud Platform. Furthermore, SIT provides a sandbox environment and a toolchain for developers to produce initial proof of concepts. DIGST supports the project.

<br>
Furture versions of the GovCloud are expected to add capabilities supporting Compliance as a Service, Development Procurement Framework, _Sharing of Sensistive Data_, _Reuse Applications/Services_, _Hybrid Cloud/Scale Out_, and _Migrating Existing Applications_ (see [appendix](#more-principles,-capabilities-and-use-cases)).



## Principles
Good architecture is based on shared principles that assists solutions in handling future unforseen problems, allowing the GovCloud to evolve with less escalation of desicisions, and clarifying where substantial diagreement exists.

The following principles has been identified:

**_Continious service availabilty_: GovCloud platform and application services are build to deliver uninterupted service even during new releases and platform maintainance.**

Applications used by public agencies are often critical, not only to the agency itself, but to the society in general. Even so, some services have traditionally had so called service windows, where services were suspended and to allow for new software relases. Digital self-services have changed this. The general public is now serving itself at times suitable for the costumer instead of the service provider.

This means deployed services run continuously and must be build accordingly. Cloud technology can enforce some of this, but services must be designed for high availabilty, automated testing and detailed monitoring.

Problems must be solved imidiately and in close collaboration between platform consumers, platform providers and software vendors. The GovCloud provides clear seperation of responsibilities, but recognizes that solutions are found in collaboration, and that the collaboration must be supported efficiently tools provided as part of the GovCloud.

High availability is not only a concern for the platform it self, but is a result of carefull planing across all dependencies from electrical power, bandwidth, incident reaction time and capacity to solve problems when they arise.

Service availability is an extension of the cloud characteristica of measured services. THe health of the platform and it's individual services most be continiously monitored.


**_Vendor Neutrality:_ Applications and data shall be portable from one cloud platform to another without unreasonable effort.**

Public agencies can not allow their data or applications to be locked-in to a specific vendor. From a regulatory point of view, public procurement should support competition and not favour a specific propriatary tehcnology or sole vendor. From a strategic perspective, it should be possbile to move public services between organisation, and additionally have them  intergrated into new operational landscapes. This principle supports the characteristic of provider resource pooling.

Exposed interfaces are standardized and supported by Open Source implementations. Interfaces towards customers and interfaces exposed internally between platform and applications shall be selected on the basis of their support in the open source community. Selecting interfaces suopported by open source ensures a licens-free fall back option, if the benefits of licensed implementions are not balanced with the price. Standardization ensure a clear governance of changes and transparent terms of use.

Applications are containarized. By choosing widely adopted container technologies the binding between applications and operation environment is broken. Containarized applications declare their required ressources and relies on configurations from their environement.

Propriatary technolgies are used with caution. When used, the imidiate benefits needs to be evaluated against future costs of the binding. A part of the evaluation is to describe a likely exit strategy for replacing propiatary technology with more open.

Furthermore applications are containerised. By choosing widely adopted container technologies the binding between applications and operations environment is broken. Containerised applications declare their required resources and rely on configurations from their environment.

**_Highly Scalable_: Both the governance, operating process and technology support a high number of applications with a limited addition of ressources.**

[Finalize in 1.0 after discussion]
- R: Operation at Scale, but also predictable and repeatable
- Q: Fair Use. over detailed contracts
- Q: Simplify procurement
- Q: Selfservice - Automated testing...


**_Predictable Cost_: The operating model ensures predictable consumer costs suitable for public sector budget guidelines.**

Government organisations are interested in fixing variable Costs, or at least having defined caps, to control risk and comply with guidelines. The GovCloud cost model must align well with other budget items and not expose consumers to greater economic risks than other technological solutions.

Application services used by government organisations for data acess, should generally be developed by the data consuming organisation. But this does not help to limit costs when data services are exposed to the general public. In this case *fair use* agreements could be made with data consumers and their compliance being monitored.

Costs should reflect the use, maintainance and continiously improvement of the GovCloud. Consumers with services deployed on the platform should not be required to contribute beyond the initial agreement for continued hosting. In the case of new services or considerable change in use patterns, costs should re-negotiated.


<br>
In future versions new principles may be included e.g.  *Compliance as a Service*, *Reuse of data and applications*.(see [appendix](#more-principles,-capabilities-and-use-cases))

The GovCloud is also expected to support a larger government initiative on benefitting from cloud technology. A future strategic general principles could look like the following:

**_Cloud First:_ Cloud technologies are prefered when designing new applications and new integrations between existing applications.**

Cloud technology is maturing and has proven to support large scale operations and rapid development. The essential charateristics of a cloud are Consumer on-demand self-service, Broad network access, Provider resource pooling, Rapid elasticity and Measured services cf. [NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-145/final).

Cloud First means that cloud technology shold always be considered when designing. Simply because the above mentioned characteristica are generally desirable and for the foreseen future best can be reached through the use of cloud technology. A Cloud First principle etails second and perpherps third alternatives. Organisations should always choose the best tool for the job, duly respecting the relative long life time of government it-solutions and the everchanging overall organisation.




## Reference model
To identify the different components in the architecture, we use a conceptual model based on a number of excisting frameworks, including
[Microsoft Cloud Service Foundation Reference Model](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/cloudsolutions/2013/08/15/cloud-services-foundation-reference-architecture-reference-model/), [IBM Cloud Garage Method](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/), [OpenGroup IT4IT](http://www.opengroup.org/it4it) and [NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication500-292.pdf). A total detailed view of all elemements can be found in appendix of this document.


![](areas.svg)

From the frameworks above a number of business roles and process has been selected for this architecture. The business roles are Cloud Consumer, Cloud Provider, Application Responsible, Application Developer, Data Responsible. One additional role is introduced supporting the aspects of cloud usage in a government setting, Cloud Policy Owner.

The business processes around a cloud platform can be organized into four main areas:


*Platform Delivery.* This area is responsible for translating Cloud Consumer requirements into platform services. Capabilities and technologies are provided with a specific service level agreement. All changes follow a transparent governance process with consumer involvement.

*Development.* This area translate requirements into application services. Development is primarily done by a third party Application Developer acting on behalf of a Platform Consumer, but can also be done by a Platform Consumers employees. Platform services follow the same processes and are developed by Cloud Provider employees or third parties.. Application services can generalised into platform services in a collaboration between Policy Owner, Platform Provider and Application Responsible.

*Operations.* This area encapsules processes applied to the platform and its applications to meet the requirement in service level agreements. Processes are typically highly automated to minimize human error and labor. End-user behaviour is monitored to constiniously improve services.

Processes in Development and Operations are increasingly considered as overlapping, especially in the case of self service cloud services, where a consumers take a larger part in the operational aspects of service delivery. One definition of [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources?isbn=978-0134049847) *is a set of practices intended to reduce the time between committing a change to a system and the change being placed into normal production, while ensuring high quality.*

*Audit.* Auditing are processes of independent examination through controls with the intent to express an opinion. An opinion can be on the compliance with standards. Audits are based on objective evidence and may evaluate terms of security controls, privacy impact, performance, etc.

<br>
The four business areas above are supported by technology components in three areas:

*Management and support.* The components in this area supports the capabilities defined by the DevOps business area and support the consumer self-service characteristics of a cloud. Components also provides data to Platform and Service Delivery supporting Meassured Services and fair billing.

*Platform.* Platform components are aggregated with Infrastructure and Management and Support components to provide Platform as a Service (PaaS). Platform components are mostly provided as services to be consumed by applications, but they may also be consumed directly by end-users.

*Infrastructure.* Infrastructure components provide the necessary environment to run the platform. Infrastructure can be on-premise or extended with Infrastructure as a Service from an private provider. Infrastructure is heavily-standardized to facilitate both automation in the environment, and to optimize volume purchases of hardware and software.


## Design
The initial design of the GovCloud consists of a number of design decisions and the rationals behind them. Decisions are named in bold and brackets throughout the description of each element. During the establishment decisions can be changed following the established service lifecycle management processes.

The business areas (green) of the reference model is the focus of the interaction between GovCloud consumers and GovCloud provider. The technology areas (blue) are included to verify that business processes are supported by tehcnology and that no technology areas are left un-governed.

### Platform Delivery
![](delivery.svg)

Statens IT is the strategically appointed provider of IT operation and service to the Danish Government and shall as such provide the requested cloud environment.

**[PaaS]** The operation model of GovCloud is Platform as a Service offered by SIT within existing license to operate.

NIST defines the capability provied to the consumer in the PaaS operating model as: *to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.*

PaaS is choosen over IaaS to limit the ammount of operational knowledge required by government organisations. SIT is setup to lift this requirement from other organisations.

As such, consumers are responsible for the developement and maintainance of applications, data management, awarding and revoking user rights and licensing of software. SIT as a Platform Provider is responsible for updating platform software, automated testing of both applications and platform during updates, monitoring and reporting on services.

The GovCloud operating model is based on a collaborative agreement between  government organisations and follows traditional practices. Most importantly this does not allow for economic sactions and private law contracts. Conflicts needs to be solved through excisting government fora and budgetting practices.

SIT has established business support functions across a few operating models. Initially PaaS will be a supplement to existing models and will benefit from establised practices concerning agreements, reporting and financing. SIT's existing SaaS offering will still be provided. SIT may use the GovCloud as a basis for SaaS offerings to further harmonize the operational environment.


<br>
For the initial applications processes related to the management of Platform Service Lifecycle and Platform Service Level needs to be established.


#### Service Lifecycle
Transparent governance process are necessary for Platform Consumers to evaluate fit-for-porpuse of the operating model.

**[Consumer driven]** The service life cycle of GovCloud is based on consumer needs, in a feature catalogue maintained by SIT, and prioritized by a joint public group lead by DIGST in corporation with SIT.

Establishment of platform services, changes to service level agreements and exposed interfaces are the primary areas of governance. To support the principle of vendor neutrality supported interfaces most be carefully curated. And the choices should support the more general 'business' strategy.

In a two-way negotiation between consumer and provider on individal projects, the overall strategic goals of goverment-it is at risk of taking second priority. To ensure the allignment of overall strategy and it-roadmaps the responsibility of roadmap decisions is placed with the Platform Policy Owner.

**[Support lifetime]** Each supported feature (technology, interface or platform service) in GovCloud has a planned minimum lifetime supporting Cloud Consumers long term planing.

The products used to implement the platform will likely have many features that are less desirable to have an application depend on. To support the principle of vendor neutrality (and its goal of moveable applications) only a subset of said features is selected and supported.

When designing applications, Platform Consumers must make informed decissions about the use of available features of GovCloud. Therefore planned support lifetime for each feature must be explicit. For technologies the vendor support and for interfaces the release plans of standard organisations should be taken into consideration. Platform services are more locally controlled and the support time can be agreed upon among current service users.

Application developers may have valid reasons to use unsupported services, and
often development time and the code lines can be greatly reduced by clever use of a platform. When applications rely on unsupported features it is important to estimate the immidiate savings and compare those with  future costs in the event of unsupported features becoming unavailable.

Unsupported features will be used and Platform Consumers should be alerted as soon as they are brought to the attention ofg the Platform Provider is aware of planned changes e.g. in updated roadmaps from technology providers.

#### Service Level
The selected operating model (PaaS) separates responsibilities between the Platform Provider and the Platform Consumer. However, in government collaboration, a running platform with a failing application is a failed public service. Citizens and businesses  only care that the service is brought back up and not what part of government (or even private vendor) is to blame. As such, service levels and separation of duties are designed to support a common goal of high service availability.


**[24/7 platform]** SIT continously monitor all services, reports swift on incidents, initiate problem solving and bring in support from external professional services when necessarry.

When SIT identifies a failing service an incident is created. First efforts are made to restart services and identify underlaying problems. SIT can not be expected to have knowledge about the internal workings of applications, and if first efforts does not bring services up, the service provider is involved. The SLA includes specific reaction times and escalation criteria.

SIT does not support the deployment of new releases outside normal business hours (except of cause in the process of resolving incidents).

**[24/7 services]** Platform Consumers wanting to host 24/7 application must provide resources to collaborate with the Platform Provider on solutions to incidents.

Platform Consumers help identify problems by providing knowledge of the inner workings of applications. When Platform Provider and Platform Consumer agree on the problem a suggested solution is decided upon. Solutions can be fixes to platform services, workarounds delivered as new application versions or combinations hereof.

Highly available services are a result of carefull design, early detection of problems and the required capabilities to fix them. Carefull design is supported by devepoment guidelines and general cloud practices. Detection of problems is supported by automated testing and health monitoring. Required capabilities covers both specific products, their configuration, dependencies and underlying infrastructure. The availability and cost of these support from technology providers must be considered when deciding the roadmap and should be contractually specifie by the Platform Provider when possible.



Processes of identifying and resolving problems are separated from incident management. SLA should also govern Platform Customers’ responsibility to participate in this process when needed.


### Platform Operations
![Platform Operation](operations.svg)

Existing established processes at SIT are not suitable for DevOps and automation. Since ITIL and IT4IT are well supported in existing tools and a considerable amount of training has been done both at SIT and it's customers, new processes are based on those frameworks.

**[ITIL]** SIT establishes processes suitable for cloud platform operations based on the ITIL framework.

The required service uptime has consequences for the design of especially the incident process. The time of incident (during normal business hours, weekends or international holidays) will influence e.g. what contact information to use, what resources are preferred and when to report to management.

The initial application will have impact on existing processes for Access Management, Configuration Management and System Administration.


#### Access Management
The Public Data Sharing use case, combined with the specific need to identify consumers of the DMI data, is not covered by excisting access management at SIT.

**[API Keys]** Public Data Sharing is supported by a GovCloud platform service for API key management.

Specifically, the Platform Consumer establishes processes for on-boarding data consumers and SIT provides a back-end service to generate and store API keys and contact information. The API Key management should be generic and be used for all applications that share public data with private businesses and the public in general.

**[Existing IAM]** Identities and access rights necessary for development of applications and operation of platform are store in SITs prefered central Identify and Access Management system.



#### System Administration
Existing SIT SysAdm tools are chosen for the support of the operation of an environment dominated by Windows OS. However the GovCloud will be based on Linux and employees are not expected to operate in both environments. Furthermore the 24/7 operation might require employess to work from home or on the road.

**[SysAdm tooling]** GovCloud operators choose tools suitable for automation and remote management based on individual experiences.

Since the efficiency and comfortableness of platform operators have a huge impact on service levels and quality of solutions, the choice of tools must also take into account individual preferences.

#### Configuration Management

The configuration of GovCloud is done internally in SIT. For the first version, configuration changes to applications are sent to SIT and manually applied. This process is covered by the SLA.

**[Manual Config]** Tools chosen for configuration management in version 1.0 must support implementing self-service for application owners in future versions.

Configuration is under version control and should have high availabilty matching other critical parts of the platform.


### Service DevOps
![](devops.svg)

The development and operation of applications must be supported by an efficient tool chain. To help government organisations adapt agile development in a cloud setting, a joint public, fully supported tool chain is chosen and provided as part of the GovCloud Platform.

The use of the toolchain is recommended and can function as a guide for competences across development vendors. However, not all Platform Consumers (and more importantly their developers) can be expected to adhere to tool choices made by Platform Policy Owner.

**[Gov Dev Tool]** SIT offers an enterprise grade 'Government Development Toolchain' as Software as a Service to support agile application development

The tool chain will consist of professional, enterprise grade tools.  SIT offers the toolchain preconfigured and integrated with existing user and access management. Licenses are provided by Platform Consumers or procured in bulk by SIT where possible. The tool chain used in sandboxes should be available to consumers and prospective costumers free-of-charge with a limited number of floating trial licenses.

End-user support and traning is done outside of SIT.

The initial toolchain is based on Jira, Git, Jenkins and SOAP UI.

**[Consumer Tool]** Platform Consumers may choose between SIT’s SaaS tool chain and providing their own tool chain, contingent on the Platform Consumer’s tool chain’s complete integration with the build and test processes from SIT.

The build and test process are required to follow the SIT defined flow to allow SIT to rebuild images and reploy services after changes on the platform.


**[Staging]** Applications, services and data sets can deployed to multiple stages of the GovCloud.

Stages can be used by application developers to run test befor deploying, by platform provider to test updates of platform technologym, to preview new features and to supply sandboxes.

Most importantly stages are not implemented as seperate physical environments with seperate lifecycles. All stages are implemented on the same Gateway, Application and Data fabric, taking advantages of the buildin seperation of ressources and access.



#### Build

The source of application and platform services are stored at the Platform Provider to support rebuilds even when an external code repository is out of reach.

**[Build Image]** Docker images are build from source using custom image maintained by SIT.

In the very definition of PaaS, the provider chooses which *programming languages, libraries, services, and tools* to suopport.  The custom build and test images defines the supported technology stack on the platformn. The GovCloud aims to provide a seamless process of bringing services into production.

The custom build and test image allows developers to replicate the features of the automated deploy processes used by SIT on their local machine.

The build and test image is governed as part of the generel service life cycle.


#### Test

**[Test Image]** Automated test of services are done using a custom image maintained by SIT.

As above, this allows test to be carried out on local developer machines in an environment that closely match the one used in production.

**[Acceptance test]** Service passing the provided automated tests are considered running.

Because the same virtual machine is use to build and test services at both the consumer and provider, the automated test can also be used as a form of acceptance test. That is, the GovCloud provider can rely on the test to verify that a service is running after an upgrade of the underlying platform. A side effect to this, is that if a service is behaving un-expected after a platform update, new tests should be write to provide better test coverage for future updates.

**[Sandbox]** SIT provides limited unsupported free-of-charge GovCloud ressources to existing and prospect consumers.

Sandboxes can help the uptake of the GovCloud among existing customers and private vendors interested in providing developers to government agencies can familiarize them self with the prefered setup before project establishment.

The user access management to the sand box is seperated from the rest of the GovCloud. SIT Customers can request temporary accredentials for employees and 3rd party developers to evaluate features and the tool chain.v Sand boxes have no support, no SLA and will be erased after a specified number of days.

The limited cost of sandboxes can be taken up by existing users. They will benifit significantly from each new application and customer through the economy of scale.

#### Release

**[Release]** Consumers label images in the repository for release based on test results.

In the initial version SIT will manually deploy images on request from the Application Developer or Platform Consumer. This request can be automated from the image repository.

A common labeling schema should be maintained with clear definitions and consequences of labeling an images. The labeling schema should support the Platform Providers fx by pointing to 'last known working version', 'prefered version' and 'never-deploy-this-again version'.



#### Deploy

**[Deploy]** In the initial version releases of new versions of applications services are done manually by SIT on request from customer.

The time from labeling to deplyoment during normal business hours should be specified in the SLA.

**[Scaleable]** Every service is deployed with a scaling schedule.

A scaling schedule allows the application fabric to automatically scale the number of running instances to support the workload. By requiring every service to be behind a scaling mechanisme, every service will also be able to be run in various versions during rolling updates. This is critical to support the principle of continious service availabilty.

In future versions the deployment of new service versions or new configuration should not require manually steps from the Platform Provider. The only exception to this is changes to the scaling schedule. Scaling schedules should be reviewed by the Platform Provider to ensure *fair use* and support in capacity planing.


#### Operate

**[SharedOperation]** SIT provides collaborative tools to support collaboration during normal operation and during incident handling.

### Audit
Auditing features are not in scope for the initial version of GovCloud, but will be required when the number of applications grow or data sets containg personal or other sensitive data are introduced.


### Management and support
![](support.svg)

The elements in this area is choosen to support continious service availability and the need for rapid deployment of new version of services.

#### Service Monitoring

**[Monitoring]** Applications and services implement a common schema for monitoring and logging, and are monitored and reported in SITs existing tools.

A schema could include 'ping' to signal a live service, 'trace' to signal if a services can ping all required services and a 'EventId' to join logs across different services.

The schema should be a part of Federated Digital Architecture provided by the Cloud Policy Owner.



#### Service management

**[SLA management]** SIT is using existing tools and channels to provide data on the fullfillment of SLA and other agreements.

#### Configuration Management

**[Versioned Configuration]** SIT is using existing tools to maintain versions of configuration items used in the platform and in platform services.

#### Authorization
**[Rights]** All access rights (end-users and other services) are given by service or data responsible to identities recognized by the secure token service.

**[Authorization]** Access policy on service level is enforced in Gateway, Access policy on data level in Service

#### Authentication

Authentication of application users follow the principles in the Federate Digital Architecture and allows private businesses and goverment organisations to choose an Identity Provider that suits its needs best.

**[Federation]** Authentication of end-users are done in federation.

**[Attribute Based Access Policy]** Access policies should rely on trusted attributes over detailes rights when possible.

However this requires trust to be established between the GovCloud and external Identity Providers. Trust levels and other policies and specifications follow the FDA.

#### Directory

**[Central Directory]** Users, Applications, Services and Dataset are ressources registered in the central directory service at SIT.

#### Data protection
Distribution copies of data sets does not need to be protected from deletion, since the original data set is stored by the data owner.

In future version, data owners might choose to store the original data in the GovCloud and should be provided with the necessary back up and other data protection features.

#### Fabric Management

Platform operates should have central operation capabilities over all elements of the API, Application and Data fabric.


#### Artifact repository

**[Registry]** The artefact repository is [Docker Registry Server](https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/#use-an-insecure-registry-testing-only).

Configuration of environments are done via management.

Artefact are identified in the directory, semantic versioned and taged with a common schema for release.


### Platform
![](platform.svg)

The platform is designed for clear seperation of the management of data and application and for the protection of ressources exposed to the internet. On the highest level of abstraction, this leads to

**[Platform Layers]** Three seperate layers: gateway, application, data

#### Gateway

**[KrankenD]** The API Gateway is [KrakenD](http://www.krakend.io/).

The product is choosen for its price, scaleability, distributed configuration, support of API throttling and OAuth.

#### Application fabric

**[Kubernetes]** The application environment is [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

The product is choosen for its price, widespread adoption and ressource handling. It has been choosen over variants with self-service portals, because the vision of a seamless and stable consumer experience across the different technologies in the GovCloud.

#### Data fabric

**[MapR]** The data fabric is [MapR](https://mapr.com/).

The product has been choose because of its proven quick implementation, enterprise features and highly manageability.


#### Platform services

**[API Service]** Private users of Open Government Data on the GovCloud are registered with a API key.

This platform service allows a common *fair use* agreement, a communication channel for data owners and framework for specific data use agreements.

**[Secure Token Service]** All services use a common secure token platform service.

This platform service allow access policies in applications to described without binding them to specific identity providers. This is known pattern for implementing the stragies on user manangement decided in the FDA.

**[Log Service]** All services use a common logging service.

This platform service allow for the protection and audit of logs across multiple services and applications.

**[Code service]** The code repository of applications and platform services is [GIT] and is a platform service at SIT.

GIT is the most used repository and supports highly distributed development environments, effectiv branching and merging and has widespread build-in support in developer tools. GIT supports advances repository synchronisation and Platform consumers or Application Developers can choose to rely on these features for local development. GIT is also suitable for automation of build and test process to support the desired scaleability of development.

### More principles, capabilities and use cases

**Cloud Broker** - cloud services are consumed through a central cloud broker.

Regulatory issues on the use of public cloud services for sensitive personal data in a government settings are still unclear. Even with clearification, some critical data are still to be kept on danish territory and under strict control. But even critical applications need better time to market and cloud technologies can support this. Hence the need for a onpremise infrastructure based on cloud technologies.

At the same time the cost efficiency of public cloud offerings are hard to match. But government organisations will soon find integration of cloud services can be too complexto manage. A cloud consumer may request cloud services from a cloud broker, instead of contacting a cloud provider directly. A cloud broker is an entity that manages the use, performance and delivery of cloud services and negotiates relationships between cloud providers and cloud consumers. [NIST definition of Cloud Broker](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication500-292.pdf)

The cloud broker will take advantage of a competitative market by moving applications to the most best available platforms. Reason can be applications with no personal data or when needed capabilities are only accessible as SaaS at cloud providers.


Furture versions of the GovCloud is expected to add capabilities  on

- *Compliance as a Service.* The GovCloud will differ from existing cloud vendors in regard to establising and assuring compliance with regulatory and strategy requirements. Clarification of compliance can add years to project time and is a major barriere to better time to market. The GovCloud will over time establish more compliance assurances and offer them as shared services. The focus will initial be on data protection, public procurement, and the joint public digitalisation strtegy.

- *Development procurment framework* Since the GovCloud is expected to be used by many public organisations, the general software and development market will be familiarized with the environment and it processes. In a market perspective, the GovCloud can function as a harmonization of services, which can lead to an increased and more transparent competition. This can further be supported by a common framework for procuring application development build to be hosted on the GovCloud.

- *Hybrid Cloud/Scale Out?*
[Expand]

to support a number of new use cases

- *Sharing of sensistive data*
An existing customer at SIT wants to access data from another organisation. The data is not available at any existing dataservices. SIT suggests the data owner to replicate the data onto the GovCloud. The data user builds a custom dataservice and reuses existing security controls incl identity management.

- *Reuse Application/Service.* A software vendor delivers an application to a customer of SIT. The vendor wants to deploy on the GovCloud preparing for more customers. The vendor sells a license to another SIT customer and SIT extends the installation and the software product is available to the new customer.

- *Migrate existing application.* SIT has identified a customer application that is sutiable for hosting on the new GovCloud. SIT plans a transition with the customer and reuse a number of exsiting services and datasets in the Cloud and can turn off some application elements.
